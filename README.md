# Learning Diary — MIT 6.100L (Python)

This repository contains my personal **learning diary and code solutions** from the  
**MIT 6.100L Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python** course.  

### Progress so far:
- Completed and documented code from **Lectures 1 to 12**.  
- Each lecture’s code is added in [`learning-diary.md`](learning-diary.md) with proper formatting.  
- Updates are done through branches and pull requests for tracking progress.  

### Purpose:
To consistently practice Python, understand programming concepts deeply,  
and maintain a record of progress in a structured format.
